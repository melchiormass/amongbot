# amongbot
A simple node.js bot for Discord used to mute or unmute everyone in a server with one command.


Before using the bot script, you need a Discord Bot Token to create your own bot and make sure you have node.js installed.

Go to https://discord.com/developers/applications, login and go to applications and create a new one.
Then, go to the bot section and create a new one for yourself.

Take the token and copy it to the bot.js file and replace the 'YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN' by the token value you got.

Start your node.js application by doing this commands in order :
```
npm init
npm install discord.js
node bot.js

```
